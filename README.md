# old_but_gold___php_cms_beeco
Once upon a time... i'd created my own Content Management System, which still works.

## Beeco CMS

About 20 years or more, i created my own CMS in PHP. Many website ran with it,
but now they are renewed with modern techniques.

So i'd decided to release the source to the public, to inspire anyone who's starting coding.

### Features

* own little template engine

* plugin system

* self made login captcha

* plugins like: image gallery, contact form, guestbook, search, and more.

* Wyswig Content Editor (based on old tinyMCE, not pushed to this github).

* installation script

### Additional Stuff not released

* Wyswig Editor, because it's based on the old tinyMCE Code and Licencse

* Server-Side PHP FTP Server, which simulates an FTP Server to manage and upload pictures inside the gallery.

* Font files kept away from this repository.

### Issues?

I'm not developing this anymore, but i'm open to learn new things. 
Give me tipps and hints. What have i made good in the past, what have i made wrong?
